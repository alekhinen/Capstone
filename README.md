# Capstone / Light Loops
This project was initiated in the Fall of 2016 for Northeastern University's ARTG4700: Interaction Team Degree Project. The group organically formed around the idea of wanting to build something that didn't have a clearly defined purpose â€“ instead the purpose would come from the process of building it and the experiences had from using it. Everything we're making here is generative. We want every experience to be unlike any other. 

Here's a sequence of images of a user testing our prototype installation (24 Feb 2017):
